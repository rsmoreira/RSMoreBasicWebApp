NGBP = NG BOILERPLATE = ENGINE BOILERPLATE = BOILERPLATE JS Structure 

1) Node JS 

	install Nodejs - from https://nodejs.org/

2) Grunt
	Grunt is a client side tasks config, like ant. 
	
	install Grunt Cli - from http://gruntjs.com/getting-started
	After installed nodejs, run next command from command line as admnistrator: npm install -g grunt-cli

3) Bower
	Bower is a client side dependencies manager, like maven, but only for js dependencies.
	
	install bower - from http://bower.io/

	After installed nodejs, run next command from command line as admnistrator: npm install -g bower

4) GIT
	Git is a repository manager (used for github management). 
	
	install GIT for windows - https://msysgit.github.io/

	This is a wizzard installation. Remember to configure your windows path variable. There is an option 
	to do this on the wizzard installation.

5) BOILERPLATE (NG Boilerplate)
	Boilerplate is a client side structure for development.
	Installation:
		It isn't an application, it is an structure that you can 'pull'(clone) from github using github
		commands. 
		
		Project on github: https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp
		
		To install BOILERPLATE, you can clone the structure into your project webapp folder. Like this:
			(When I did it at the first time, I did a clone into the app folder. But I had problems to commit it
			into my github project.)
			From command line as administrator... 
			\<your_project>\src\main\webapp> git clone https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp.git app
			
			into the your project webapp folder... 
				GIT CLONE <boilerplate project on github> <name of the folder to create and place boilerplate>
				
		You can also download the NG Boilerplate e place into your project (if you want to commit it)
		When I downloaded it, placed in /ngbp folder. 
		
		
6) Download Boilerplate/Node dependencies

	Take a look on this dependencies on file .../webapp/ngbp/package.json
	
	To download, into the app folder (<name of the folder to create and place boilerplate>), executing command line 
	as administrator:
		.../webapp/ngbp/npm install

		
7) Download Bower dependencies

	Take a look on this dependencies on file .../webapp/ngbp/bower.json
	
	To download, into the ngbp folder (<name of the folder to create and place boilerplate>), executing command line 
	as administrator:
		.../webapp/ngbp/bower install
		
8) Adjusts mvc-dispatcher-servlet.xml setting resources 

	You need to fix your MVC Resources tag into the mvc-dispatcher-servlet.xml file, pointing to our ngbp structure.
		
	<mvc:resources mapping="/ngbp/**" location="/ngbp/build/" />
	
	obs: build folder only appears after your /grunt watch. 

9) GRUNT WATCH
	
	This command generate our build folder.
	
	.../webapp/ngbp/grunt watch
	
	All of our client side development, will be done into /ngbp/src folder. 
	Grunt Watch will build this developing and place into /ngbp/build folder.
	
	obs: Grunt Watch do it simultaneously.
	

10) Angular-resource 

	Angular-resource is used to client side interact with other resources of your project, like endpoints (json).
	
	To install, download the dependencies using bower.
		
		.../webapp/ngbp/bower install angular-resource
	
		Maybe you will be asked to choose the dependency in a list, if get this question, choice angular-resource (obviously).
	
		This install command will download angular-resource to your ../webapp/ngbp/vendor folder, take a look there looking for angular-resource.
	
	Configure Angular, to our boilerplate structure use it.
	
		Open the file ../webapp/ngbp/build.config.js looking for 'vendor_files', adding the angular resource downloaded.
			
			()
	Problems with angular-resource
	
		I got some problems, probably because I was using a newer angular-resource version compared to angular version.
		So I adjusted the bower.json (../webapp/ngbp/bower.json) to put there the correct version of angular-resource. 
			obs: 
				boilerplate are using angular 1.2.28 at this time and when running 'bower install angular-resource', I
				was downloading angular-resource version 1.4.4. 
		To solve the problem I adjusted the bower.json, adding the angular-resource dependency:
			../webapp/ngbp/bower.json
			{
			  "name": "ng-boilerplate",
			  "version": "0.3.2",
			  "devDependencies": {
				"angular": "~1.2",
				"angular-mocks": "~1.2",
				"bootstrap": "~3.1",
				"angular-bootstrap": "~0.10.0",
				"angular-ui-router": "~0.2",
				"angular-resource": "~1.2" // here is our angular-resource dependency with same version as angular.
			  },
			  "dependencies": {}
			}
		After it, I've deleted the bower dependencies (on vendor folder) and run again 'bower install'. Take care when
		deleting the vendor folder. You need to keep there 'placeholders' folder.
